# Homework 4

### Authorï¼š Jiayi Xue

**Background:**

The website is developed to showcase the graph using simulated data. 

**Methods:**

Initially, a dataset with 30 observations was created. Then we generated the age variable using a normal distribution with a mean of 57 years and a standard deviation of 15. Next we alternatively simulate the age variable using a t-distribution. For graphical representation, histograms of the age variable were plotted to visualize and compare the empirical distribution against the theoretical normal distribution curve, which aids in understanding how the age variable is distributed across the simulated observations. Finally, we created html website using command.


```
<<dd_do:nooutput>>

clear 

// initiate dataset
set seed 0425
set obs 30

// generate variables
capture drop age age_t
// normal distribution
gen age = (rnormal() * 15) + 57
// t distribution
gen age_t = (rt(_N) * 15) + 57

//graphical representation
hist age, ///
   fcolor(orange%40) /// simulated normal 
   addplot(hist age_t, fcolor(midblue%50)) /// simulated t-distribution 
   normal /// theoretical normal
   legend(on ///
      lab(1 "Sampled from Normal") ///
	  lab(2 "Theoretical Normal") ///
	  lab(3 "Sampled from t-distribution") ///

**Distribution of Age**

<<dd_graph>>



```
<<dd_do>>
display c(N) 
display c(k)  
list in 1/5 
<</dd_do>>
```

**Results**

The histogram plot displays the approximate distribution of simulated data derived from normal distribution  $ \text{Age, years} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 57, \sigma^2 = 225) $ and t-distribution, respectively.

**Footnote:** 
The results are based on simulated data.
